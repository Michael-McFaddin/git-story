This is a story about practicing git. Next, I will delete something.
I didn't realize git was not the same as github. Lets see how changing this in git goes. Now, I am going to add this line and see what happens.

Lets add another line to make sure I am getting the hang of this.
Now lets add and practice pushing to github.

Woohoo!
